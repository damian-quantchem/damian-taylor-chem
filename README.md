# DFT-Based Modeling of Catalytic Reaction Mechanisms

This repository documents computational workflows used to investigate
**catalytic activity, selectivity, and reaction energetics** using
density functional theory (DFT).

The focus is on mechanistic analysis of catalytic systems relevant to
heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, with an emphasis on
**reaction pathways, adsorption energetics, and transition-state analysis**.

## Scientific Scope

Density Functional Theory calculations are employed to:

- Quantify adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates
- Compare competing reaction pathways and rate-determining steps
- Analyze structure–activity relationships in transition-metal catalysts
- Support interpretation of experimentally observed catalytic trends
- Benchmark AI-assisted or ML-generated mechanistic hypotheses

The methodologies reflected here align with standard practices used in
academic computational chemistry research environments, including those
at UC Berkeley.

## Computational Methodology

Typical workflows include:

- Geometry optimization of reactants, intermediates, and products
- Single-point energy calculations using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
  and hybrid functionals
- Transition state identification and validation via frequency analysis
- Zero-point energy and thermal corrections
- Construction of reaction energy profiles

Where applicable, results are cross-validated against
AI-assisted simulation outputs to assess internal consistency and physical plausibility.
